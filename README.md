# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Project

This repository contains an implementation of **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** for dimensionality reduction and visualization. The project processes data, applies LDA, and visualizes the results using Python and associated libraries.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets used for LDA.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, LDA implementation, and visualization.
- **results/**: Saved output figures and analysis reports.
- **src/**: Python scripts for LDA computation and helper functions.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Features

1. Data preprocessing, including scaling and encoding.
2. Dimensionality reduction using LDA.
3. Visualization of LDA results (e.g., scatter plots and histograms).
4. Support for classification tasks using LDA-transformed data.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lda-project.git
   cd lda-project
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to explore and visualize data:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/lda_analysis.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Apply LDA to reduce dimensions.
   - Visualize the results with scatter plots and histograms.

## Visualization

LDA results are visualized using matplotlib. Example output:

- **Scatter Plot**: Displays data projected onto LDA components.
- **Histogram**: Shows distribution of data along each LDA component.

Ensure your data is labeled correctly to observe class separability in the LDA-transformed space.

## Data Requirements

The input dataset should:
- Be in `.csv` format.
- Contain both features and target labels.
- Have categorical target values (e.g., `Dropout` and `Graduate`).

Example of a valid dataset structure:

| Feature1 | Feature2 | Feature3 | Class     |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1.2      | 0.3      | 5.1      | Graduate  |
| 0.4      | 1.8      | 2.3      | Dropout   |

## Troubleshooting

1. **ComplexWarning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part**
   - Ensure data preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling and encoding) are correctly applied.

2. **Flat visualization output**
   - Check the number of LDA components. For two classes, LDA will output only one component.

3. **Incorrect visualization**
   - Verify that the dataset has sufficient variation between classes and features are properly scaled.
